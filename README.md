# Models:            | Logistic Regression,| K Nearst Neighbor,| Naive Bayes
# Validation Results:| 0.771536            | 0.786517          | 0.711610

# Conclusion:
KNN preformed slightly better than Logistic Regression model.
I believe there will be some better models for this binary prediction(e.g.Random Forest).
But I don't want to simply apply them because we have not cover them on class yet.
